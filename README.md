# Hi there!
And thanks for checking out my mean median and mode calculator!

This is open source so feel free to do whatever you want! Bare in mind, this is made in python and uses imports so you may have to download a few things. Besides the warnings, this is reletively bug free, so enjoy absolutely destroying the code or enhancing it with what you think can make my 75 or so lines of code better!
